# 2. Counter Function

Implement the `counter` function according to requirements:

- Function accepts a number as the first argument. This number represents the
  initial value for the counter.
- If no value passed to a function, use `0` as initial value.
- Function returns array with two function:
- First function allows us to get the current counter value.
- Second function increases the internal counter value by one.
- Multiple calls of `counter` function create independent instances of counter
